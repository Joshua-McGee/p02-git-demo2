  <h3 class="h3-left"> My Education</h3>
  <p>
   My education degree specializes in Mathamatics, English. I have written and published a number of studies in the journal of educational psychology. Through my travels and studies I have concluded that everyone on earth learns differenlty and the approach a teacher takes is instrumental in their success.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am currently persuing a masters in educational psychology and tutoring as a part of my studies and as a source of income to help pay for my tuition.

  <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
  <p>
    I am a believer in life-long learning and I am passionate about the environment, human rights, mathematics, music and travel. I have lived in three Canadian provinces and have traveled to over 30 countries. Watching the sunrise from the top of Mount Sinai was by far, my most amazing experience so far.

    This year, I look forward to exploring Powell Riverâ€™s many mountains and going river rafting in class 5 rapids!

  <p>
    <em>Steven O'brian:</em> I have had Joe as my tutor for almost two years now. He is so much better then my teacher at school and explains all my homework a lot better. My grades went from C's to B's and A's because of him! He sometimes brings snacks and even helps me with my other subjects sometimes. He is always there for me and the best tutor alive!
