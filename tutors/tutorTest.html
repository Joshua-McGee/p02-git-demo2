    <h3> My Education</h3>
    <p>Very easy to work these to death. Learn when to stop. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Work that paint. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you.

  <h3>Who Am I</h3>
  <p>
    Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You are only limited by your imagination. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.

  <h3>Ratings</h3>

  <p>
    <em>The kid who does not care:</em> That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. You need the dark in order to show the light. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.
